# Rebuilt Hope Uni App
Rebuild of the Apache Cordova app made by Liverpool Hope Uni


Source code not inclued due to the fact the uni also didn't publically release their sourcecode

This is a straight up rebuild with updated plugins cleaned up file stuctures and removal of random js files that weren't needed

Any issues or errors or its not supported for u simply make an issue and ill *try* and fix it!

# Install process

## Android:
1. Download apk
2. Install apk if this fails enable unknown sources so u can install it
3. Accept warning by google play protect it's simply beacuse ive never made anything and put it on the app store

## iOS:
1. Download ipa file to your *WINDOWS* PC
2. Download and install iTunes from the Apple website not the one in the Microsoft store thats garbage and won't work
3. Download and install this: https://armconverter.com/sideloadly/SideloadlySetup64.exe
4. Open iTunes once then let it get to main screen after accepting all their garbage then close iTunes
5. Open Sideloady and drag the ipa into the app then plug in your iPhone
6. Trust the computer using the prompt on your phone
7. Enter your AppleID into the second box and hit Start
8. Enter your AppleID password and do the 2FA if needed
9. When it's done on your phone you need to go to settings -> general -> profiles & device management and you'll see your AppleID click it and hit Trust
10. Disconnect your phone and tada you have the app installed however needs to be re-signed every 7 days simply go from step 5 to the end :)

# Disclaimer
I don't have any affiliation with Liverpool Hope Uni I am simply a student there this app is a fixed version of the Hope Uni app that can be found on the Google play store here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lhu.hopeapp
If this app results in any breaches in Liverpool Hopes systems I cannot be legally held responsible due to the fact no changes to security where made from the original app code.

I have added a link to my own website within the app in order to allow people to easily find where updates will be stored that is the only change made other than disabling and fixing features and as stated before no changes in security have been made nor will ever be made
