# Rebuilt Hope Uni Android App
Rebuild of the Apache Cordova android app made by Liverpool Hope Uni


Source code not inclued due to the fact the uni also didn't publically release their sourcecode

This is a straight up rebuild with updated plugins cleaned up file stuctures and removal of random js files that weren't needed

Any issues or errors or its not supported for u simply make an issue and ill *try* and fix it!

# Disclaimer
I don't have any affiliation with Liverpool Hope Uni I am simply a student there this app is a fixed version of the Hope Uni app that can be found on the Google play store here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lhu.hopeapp
If this app results in any breaches in Liverpool Hopes systems I cannot be legally held responsible due to the fact no changes to security where made from the original app code.

I have added a link to my own website within the app in order to allow people to easily find where updates will be stored that is the only change made other than disabling and fixing features and as stated before no changes in security have been made nor will ever be made
